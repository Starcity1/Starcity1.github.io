##  Projects
<p style='font-size: 18px'>
All of my public projects can be seen in my [Github](https://github.com/Starcity1). But some projects are not yet released for the public, or are still under construction. But below I will have some small recent, public projects I find cool.
</p>

##### [Personal-Website](https://github.com/Starcity1/Starcity1.github.io)
<p style='font-size: 18px'>
This is the project you are looking at right now. A simple GitHub Pages website that use the already-implemented Jekyll's engine in GitHub to create a static website such as this one. In addition I used the <a href='https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes' target='_blank' >minimal-mistakes</a> webpage template (I am not a front-end engineer, so I have little to no experience on making a website look pretty). While this project's technical aspects are interesting by themselves to mention; the project shines on how it will be used.

<p style='font-size: 18px'>
In my perspective, the project rather represents as a way for anyone interested to see a bit on how I think and what are my interests. For me, it is a platform for myself to dump any cool article, or idea I have in mind. In fact, I intend for the bulk of this project to be my blogs. As I really want to write and document anything I deem worth sharing with a user!

##### [Rotating-Proxy](https://github.com/Starcity1/aws-rotating-proxy)
<p style='font-size: 18px'>
A recent but quick project I worked on for a week as part of a challenge to learn a but more about the AWS service. Specifically, the project deals to the idea of a 'serveless' proxy using AWS Lambda function-based service. The project used the interesting for <a href='https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/' target='_blank'>BeautifulSoup</a> library for the proxy to work. Rather a small project as the rotating-proxy does nothing but relay the requests. The project may serve as an amazing precursor for some Webscraper or other request-heavy implementation. In the sense that it will be harder to detect.
