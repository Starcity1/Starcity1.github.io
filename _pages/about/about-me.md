  - excerpt: 'I am not too much of someone who really likes sharing *everything* about themselves. But it is the minimum I can do to you, dear reader. As I believe it is important to know a bit about the author whilst reading some of their content.'

    title: About myself
    excerpt: >
        My name is David Rodriguez Sanchez. I am a Mexican who immigrated to the United States at a young age. I then studied Computer Science with minors on Mathematics and Statistics at Texas A&M University - College Station. I speciallize on Software Engineering work. I am now an incoming Software Engineer at Roblox. More specifically, I concentrate on back-end and infrastructure development. I have enjoyed coding and computers for as long as I can remember. I like to build stuff, and coding has been my main toolset to build cool stuff.
        <br/><br/>
        Outside of coding I enjoy reading and writing a lot. It's funny to say that I have a stash full of written thoughts on my phone. And I believe this personal webpage is the perfect excuse for me to share some of my thoughts/adventures. I like reading fiction, but some of my favorite books are non-fictional. These last years though, I've read a lot of technical papers and been trying my best on reading academic papers on recent dwellings in the AI world. I hope this website to be a way for me to document anything I find interesting to share across the internet.
        <br/><br/>
        I also enjoy traveling. By myself, with family, or with friends. If I have a chance to go somewhere, 90% of the time I would go. In the future I hope to visit most of Europe and Asia and truly become a well-traveled individual. If childish, I really like the idea of having a friend in every part of the world I go. So I will travel and visit as many places as I am allowed in this short run that is my life.
